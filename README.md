# Analysis of Lok Sabha Elections (India) using Power BI

## Overview / Objective

This project focuses on analyzing historical data from Lok Sabha elections ‚Äî the lower house of India's bicameral Parliament. Given the size and diversity of India's democracy, the goal is to uncover insights into:

- Voting patterns  
- Party performance  
- Regional strongholds  
- Demographic influence on elections  

The primary objective was to build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that enables scalable and meaningful visual analysis of India's general elections. This is helpful for:

- Political analysts  
- Students and researchers  
- Data science learners  
- Policy and campaign strategists

## Problem Statement

Indian elections involve thousands of constituencies, hundreds of political parties, and complex voter behaviors. Manually analyzing such data is both tedious and error-prone.

**Problem Statement:**  
_‚ÄúHow can historical Lok Sabha election data be visualized and analyzed to uncover trends in party dominance, regional patterns, voter turnout, and electoral behavior?‚Äù_

This Power BI project aims to simplify this through interactive visual storytelling.

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Performed using **Power Query in Power BI**:

- Removed null values and duplicate rows  
- Standardized party names (e.g., ‚ÄúBJP‚Äù vs ‚ÄúBharatiya Janata Party‚Äù)  
- Created calculated columns:
  - `Vote Share`
  - `Voter Turnout % = Turnout √∑ Total Electors`
  - `Winning Margin %`
- Formatted state and year columns for slicers  
- Aggregated data for:
  - State-wise & year-wise seat share
  - Gender & age distribution
  - Party-wise trends  

---

##  Power BI Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard was created featuring:

- **Bar Charts**: Party-wise vote share, top seats  
- **Line Charts**: Yearly performance trends  
- **Maps**: State-wise seat share and margins  
- **Tables & Cards**: Key figures like margin, turnout, winners  
- **Slicers**: Filter by year, party, gender, state, and more

##  Key Findings & Insights

- **BJP and INC** are the leading parties across the 3 election years, though regional dominance varies.  
- **Uttar Pradesh**, **Maharashtra**, and **West Bengal** are pivotal states due to high seat counts.  
- **Regional parties** like TMC (West Bengal), DMK (Tamil Nadu), BJD (Odisha), and AAP (Delhi) dominate their respective territories.  
- **Winning margins** tend to be tighter in urban constituencies, indicating close competition.  
- **Voter Turnout Ratio** (Turnout √∑ Total Electors) has steadily increased:
  - In **2019**, the average turnout was **~67%**, the highest in recent years.  
  - **North-eastern states** like Nagaland and Mizoram often exceed **75% turnout**.  
  - **Urban areas** like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru generally have **<55% turnout**, despite high literacy.  
- **Female representation** is increasing in both candidacy and voter participation, though still underrepresented.  
- **Vote Share vs Seats Won**: Some regional parties with small vote share manage higher seat counts due to concentrated local support.
